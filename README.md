# Klonoot

This is an attempt to copy the core functionality and user experience of Komoot, after its sale to private equity.

This would serve purely as a route planning tool. There are already many fantastic open-source navigation apps for cycling. I really loved Komoot's interface for planning trips, and would like to offer something similar for free/donations.

It relies on brouter for its routing, and leans heavily on Mapbox for the map and search implementation.

I would like to find a way to get brouter to run serverless/ as an AWS Lambda, in Order to make it more scalable, and to cut down on server costs. I have rough plans for other features I would like to implement:
